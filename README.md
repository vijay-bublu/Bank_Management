The Bank_Management

As a Java developer, I built this Banking Management System using Spring Boot and MySQL to handle banking operations such as managing accounts, customers, branches, employees, loans, and transactions. My goal was to create a structured and scalable backend system that ensures efficient banking operations with proper data management.

I designed the project using a layered architecture to separate concerns and improve maintainability.

🔹 Controller Layer (controller package) – Handles API requests and responses using @RestController.
🔹 Service Layer (service package) – Implements business logic and interacts with DAOs.
🔹 DAO Layer (dao package) – Acts as an intermediary between services and repositories.
🔹 Repository Layer (repo package) – Uses JpaRepository to manage database interactions.
🔹 Entity Layer (dto package) – Defines database tables using @Entity.

This structure ensures modularity and makes the application scalable and easy to maintain.

****Key Features I Implemented****
✅ Account Management – Create, update, and manage bank accounts.
✅ Customer Management – Register and manage customer details.
✅ Branch & Bank Management – Track different bank branches and headquarters.
✅ Employee & Branch Head Management – Manage bank staff and assign roles.
✅ Loan Management – Handle loan applications and approvals.
✅ Card Management – Issue and manage debit/credit cards.
✅ Transactions – Record and manage deposits, withdrawals, and transfers.

📌 Each feature is accessible through RESTful APIs, making the system flexible and integration-ready.

**Technologies & Tools I Used**
💻 Backend Framework: Spring Boot
💾 Database: MySQL (via Spring Data JPA & Hibernate)
🔗 API Testing: Postman
⚡ Dependency Management: Maven
🌐 Web Server: Embedded Tomcat (port 8091)


**Database Schema & Relationships**
I designed the database using Spring Data JPA with proper entity relationships.

📌 Key Entities & Their Relationships
Entity	              Description	                                   Relationships
Customer	    Stores customer details.	                        Linked to Account (OneToOne).
Account	      Stores account details (balance, type).	          Linked to Customer, Branch (ManyToOne).
Branch	      Represents a bank branch.	                        Linked to Bank, BranchHead, Employee, Account (OneToMany).
Bank	        Main bank entity.	                                Linked to Branch (OneToMany).
BranchHead	  Manages bank branches.	                          Linked to Branch (OneToOne).
Employee	    Stores employee details.	                        Linked to Branch (ManyToOne).
Loan	        Tracks loan details.	                            Linked to Customer (ManyToOne).
Card	        Represents debit/credit cards.	                  Linked to Customer (ManyToOne).
Transaction	  Logs financial transactions.	                    Linked to Account (ManyToOne).

✅ JPA handles table creation automatically using:
_spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update_

📌 This allows my database schema to evolve dynamically without manual updates.



**Things I Did Well**
✔ Followed a Layered Architecture – Organized code into separate layers for easy scalability.
✔ Used Spring Data JPA Efficiently – Managed database operations with Hibernate ORM.
✔ Designed RESTful APIs – Created well-structured endpoints with proper request mappings.
